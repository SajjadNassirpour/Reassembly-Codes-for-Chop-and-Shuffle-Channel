## Reassembly Codes for Chop-and-Shuffle Channel

The codes are written in MATLAB and generate the following results:

#### 1- Encoding/decoding mechanism for the nested VT code
#### 2- The error rate results with different choices of residue r
#### 3- The complexity of our approach and the brute-force method
#### 4- New technique to generate a single VT code with fewer parity bits

Note: Please run "Main_Running_File.m" to get the results.
